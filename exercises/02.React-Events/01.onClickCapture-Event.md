# 📌 ReactJS `onClickCapture` Event

## 🚀 What is `onClickCapture`?
In React, `onClickCapture` is an event handler that triggers during the capture phase of a click event.

Normally, events in the DOM go through two main phases:

**1. Capture Phase** – travels down from the root to the target.

**2. Bubble Phase** – travels up from the target to the root.

> 💡 Most event handlers like `onClick` work in the bubbling phase. But `onClickCapture` gives you control before the event hits the target.

## 🧠 When to Use `onClickCapture`
You might use `onClickCapture` when you need to:
- 🔍 Log or monitor interactions before they happen.
- ✅ Validate input or conditions before letting the event proceed.
- 🚫 Intercept and potentially stop an event before it reaches its destination.
- 📊 Track analytics or click behavior without interfering with normal event flow.

---

## ✍️ Basic Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  const handleClickCapture = () => {
    console.log('Capture Phase: Button clicked');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <button onClickCapture={handleClickCapture}>
        Click Me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## 🖨️ Console Output:
```html
Capture Phase: Button clicked
```
Even though `onClick` would also work, this fires earlier in the event lifecycle.

---

## 🛑 Preventing Default & Stopping Propagation
You can also stop the event or prevent default behavior during the capture phase.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class CaptureExample extends React.Component {
  handleCapture = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    event.stopPropagation();
    console.log('Capture: Stopped everything!');
  };

  handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Bubble: This will not run');
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div onClickCapture={this.handleCapture}>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
          Submit
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default CaptureExample;
```

### What Happens Here:
- ✅ `handleCapture` is triggered first.
- ❌ Default behavior (e.g., form submission) is prevented.
- 🛑 Event propagation is stopped, so `handleClick` never runs.

## 🔁 Capture vs Bubble — Side-by-Side Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class EventFlow extends React.Component {
  handleCapture = () => {
    console.log('Captured at Parent');
  };

  handleParentClick = () => {
    console.log('Bubbled to Parent');
  };

  handleChildClick = () => {
    console.log('Clicked on Child');
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div
        onClickCapture={this.handleCapture}
        onClick={this.handleParentClick}
        style={{ padding: '20px', border: '1px solid black' }}
      >
        <div
          onClick={this.handleChildClick}
          style={{ padding: '10px', backgroundColor: '#e0f7fa' }}
        >
          Click Me
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default EventFlow;
```

### Console Output (if nothing is stopped):
```html
Captured at Parent
Clicked on Child
Bubbled to Parent
```

## 🧭 Flow Summary:
1. Parent's `onClickCapture` runs first (capture phase).
2. Child's `onClick` runs next (bubble phase).
3. Parent's `onClick` runs last (bubble phase).

## 📊 Comparison Table
| Feature           | `onClick` (Bubble)       | `onClickCapture` (Capture)     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **When it fires** | After target is clicked  | Before event reaches target    |
| **Phase**         | Bubbling                 | Capturing                      |
| **Use Cases**     | Standard UI interactions | Logging, validation, analytics |
| **Cancel Event?** | Yes                      | Yes                            |

---
## ✅ Summary
- onClickCapture gives you early control in the event lifecycle.
- Ideal for logging, preventing actions, or monitoring user behavior.
- Works seamlessly with onClick for full control over event flow.
