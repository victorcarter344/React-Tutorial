# ⚛️ React Components – The Building Blocks of Your UI
React components are the **core building blocks** of any React application. Think of components like JavaScript functions that return **UI elements** — but way more powerful.

---

## 🧱 What is a React Component?

A React component is a reusable piece of code that defines how a part of your UI should look and behave. It can be either a function or a class, and it can accept inputs called props.

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts

- #### 📦 Components are independent and reusable.
- #### 🔁 You can use the same component multiple times with different data.
- #### 📥 They accept props (inputs) to display dynamic data.
- #### ⚡ Only the changed component re-renders, not the entire page.

## 🧪 First Example: A Simple Functional Component
```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello, welcome to React!</h1>;
}

export default Greeting;
```

`Hello, welcome to React!`

---

## 🧠 Types of Components

### 1️⃣ Functional Components (Recommended)

These are just JavaScript functions that return JSX. Since React 16.8, with Hooks, functional components can manage state and lifecycle too.

```jsx
function Greet(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

### ✅ Why Use Them?
- Simpler, cleaner syntax
- No this keyword
- Easier to read and test
- Support state using useState and other hooks

---

### 2️⃣ Class Components (Legacy but Supported)

These are ES6 classes that extend React.Component. They were popular before hooks.

```jsx
class Greet extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}
```

### ✅ When to Use?

- If you need advanced lifecycle methods or error boundaries
- For older React codebases that still use classes

---

## 📬 Props (Component Inputs)

Props are the way to pass data from parent to child component.

```jsx
function Greet(props) {
  return <h2>Welcome, {props.username}!</h2>;
}

// Usage:
<Greet username="Anil" />
```

### ✅ Key Points:

- Props are read-only
- Components cannot modify props
- Used for dynamic rendering

---

## 🔁 State (Component's Own Data)

State is internal data a component can change over time.

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### ✅ State Highlights:
- Declared using useState() in function components
- State changes cause re-renders
- Managed within the component

---

## 🧑‍🎨 Rendering Components

You use the `ReactDOM.createRoot().render()` method to display a component.
```jsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import Greeting from './Greeting.jsx';

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<Greeting />);
```

---

## 🧩 Composing Components (Components in Components)
React allows you to nest and reuse components freely.
```jsx
function Header() {
  return <h1>Welcome to My Site</h1>;
}

function Footer() {
  return <p>© 2025 My Company</p>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <p>This is the main content.</p>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

## 🔁 Reusing the Same Component
You can render the same component multiple times with different props.
```jsx
function Car(props) {
  return <h2>I am a {props.brand}!</h2>;
}

function Garage() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Who lives in my Garage?</h1>
      <Car brand="Ford" />
      <Car brand="BMW" />
    </>
  );
}
```

---

## 📁 Splitting Components into Files

To keep your project organized, split components into separate files.

`Car.jsx`
```jsx
function Car() {
  return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
}

export default Car;
```

`main.js`
```jsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import Car from './Car.jsx';

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<Car />);
```

## ✅ Best Practices for Components

| Practice                         | Description                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🧠 **Keep it small**             | Each component should have a single purpose            |
| 💡 **Use Functional Components** | With hooks, they’re simpler and more efficient         |
| 📤 **Lift State Up**             | When multiple components need access to the same state |
| 📦 **PropTypes**                 | Use prop validation to catch bugs early                |
| 🧹 **Split files**               | Organize components in separate files/folders          |
| 🔄 **Reusability**               | Make components flexible and reusable using props      |

## 🔚 Summary
- Components are the heart of any React app
- Use functional components for most use cases
- Pass data using props
- Manage internal data using state
- Split components for clean and maintainable code
- Reuse and nest components as needed
