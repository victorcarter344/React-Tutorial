# üß† Getting Started with React Rendering

This project is a simple introduction to how **React** renders content into a web page. It focuses on understanding the use of the `createRoot()` function and the HTML container that React uses.

---

## üìÑ index.html

The HTML file provides a container for React to mount its components. Here's a minimal version:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

- The `<div id="root"></div>` is where React will inject your app.
- The `<script>` tag loads your main JavaScript file.

## ‚öõÔ∏è main.jsx

This is where React comes to life! We use the createRoot() function to tell React where to render and what to render.

### Example: Display a Heading
```jsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <h1>Hello React!</h1>
);
```

### Example: Display a Paragraph
```jsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <p>Welcome to my React blog!</p>
);
```

## üß† Key Concepts
- Container: The HTML element (usually a div with an ID like root) where your React components are mounted.
- createRoot(): A React function that links the JavaScript app to the HTML container.
- render(): Defines what should be displayed on the page.

---
## ‚úÖ Result
When the app is loaded in the browser, React will find the `<div id="root"></div>` and display your JSX content (like `<h1>` or `<p>`) inside it.
