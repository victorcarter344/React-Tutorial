# 📄 React Forms 
This file demonstrates how to work with forms in React using controlled components and the `useState` Hook.

In React, we don't let the browser handle the form logic on its own. Instead, we use React state to control form inputs. This gives us better control over the user input and form behavior.

## 🧱 Basic Form Example
In regular HTML, a form looks like this:
```jsx
function MyForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <label>Enter your name:
        <input type="text" />
      </label>
    </form>
  );
}
```
This will work, but the page will refresh when you submit the form. That’s not ideal in React.

## ⚙️ Controlled Components
In React, we prefer to manage form inputs using state. These are called controlled components, where the input value is stored in a React state variable.
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");

  function handleChange(e) {
    setName(e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <form>
      <label>Enter your name:
        <input 
          type="text" 
          value={name}
          onChange={handleChange} 
        />
      </label>
      <p>You typed: {name}</p>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### 🔍 Explanation
- `useState("")` creates a state variable named `name`.
- `onChange={handleChange}` updates the `name` state when the input changes.
- `value={name}` connects the input field to React state.
- The `<p>` element displays the current input.

## 🎯 Adding an Initial Value
You can pre-fill the input by setting an initial state value:

```js 
const [name, setName] = useState("John");
```

## 🚀 Handling Form Submission

To stop the page from refreshing when submitting a form, add an event handler to the `onSubmit` event and use `e.preventDefault()`.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

function MyForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");

  function handleChange(e) {
    setName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault(); // Prevent page reload
    alert(`Submitted name: ${name}`);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>Enter your name:
        <input 
          type="text" 
          value={name}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
      </label>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  );
}

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<MyForm />);
```

## ✅ Summary
- Controlled components keep form data in React state.
- Use useState to store and update input values.
- Prevent default form behavior using e.preventDefault().
- Controlled inputs make form logic easier to manage.
